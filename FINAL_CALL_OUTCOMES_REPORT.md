## 💡 KEY STRATEGIC INSIGHTS

### 1. REACH EFFECTIVENESS TRENDS

**Finding:** Reach rate inversely correlates with call volume

- **High reach months** (January: 51.7%, April: 30.4%) = Lower call volumes
- **Low reach months** (June: 9.5%, July: 10.7%) = Higher call volumes

**Implication:** Quality suffers when quantity increases beyond capacity

### 2. DATA QUALITY CONCERNS

**Critical Gaps Identified:**

- 63.6% of calls have "Unknown" status
- Interest level data missing for May-August
- Delay reasons only captured for 7,846 contacts

**Impact:** Limited ability to analyze effectiveness and optimize strategies

**Recommendation:** Implement mandatory data entry fields for all calls

### 3. ENGAGEMENT QUALITY

**Positive Indicators:**

- 11.3% of reached contacts show continued interest
- 5.1% are actively considering enrollment
- Combined positive engagement: 16.4% of reached contacts

**Concern:** 72.5% of reached contacts have no interest level recorded

### 4. OPERATIONAL BOTTLENECKS

**Busy Schedule (32.9% of delays):**

- Indicates timing/flexibility issues
- **Action:** Offer evening/weekend enrollment options

**Forgetting (14.5% of delays):**

- Process complexity or lack of reminders
- **Action:** Automated follow-up sequences

### 5. SEASONAL PATTERNS

**Q1 (Jan-Mar): High Quality Era**

- Best reach rates (18.5%-51.7%)
- Consistent interest tracking (22.5%-32.4%)
- Focused, manageable volumes

**Q2-Q3 (Apr-Aug): Volume Surge Era**

- Massive scale-up in calls
- Reach rates declined to 9.5%-14.5%
- Data quality degraded
- **Implication:** Infrastructure couldn't support volume
